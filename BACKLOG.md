### Core Features Missing
 - Handle device disconnection
 - Externalise app configuration
 - Store latest device configuration on exit
 - Reconnect to the last connected devices

### Great to have features
 - Support for ERG mode
 - Support for Structured workouts
 - Support for Linux and MacOS
 - Including QT into release artifact makes it 45MB. Can I achieve lesser size with a smaller GUI library?

### Code quality
 - Linter checks
 - App state transition tests
 - Device change and reconnection tests
 - GUI Tests with mocked devices
