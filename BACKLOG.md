### Core Features Missing
 - [x] Handle device disconnection automatically
 - [ ] Externalise app configuration
 - [ ] Store latest device configuration on exit
 - [ ] Reconnect to the last connected devices on startup

### Great to have features
 - [x] Wide tables for data
 - [ ] Support for ERG mode
 - [ ] Support for Structured workouts
 - [ ] Support for Linux and MacOS
 - [ ] Including QT into release artifact makes it 45MB. Can I achieve lesser size with a smaller GUI library?

### Code quality

 - [ ] GUI Tests with mocked devices
